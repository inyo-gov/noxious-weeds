    "text": "This data report covers the monitoring of Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed) in the Lower Owens River Project (LORP) area from 2018 to 2025. The data is sourced from the ArcGIS Online Noxious Weeds 2025 feature service and provides updated spatial occurrence as of 2025.\n\n“Perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium), an introduced plant from southeastern Europe and Asia, is invasive throughout the western United States. It can establish in a wide range of environments and is a common problem in flood plains, irrigation structures, pastures, wetlands, riparian areas, roadsides, and residential site. Recent surveys identify perennial pepperweed as a weed problem in nearly all of California, and both the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and California Invasive Plant Council (Cal-IPC) list it as a noxious weed of great ecological concern.” - UC IPM\n\nCalifornia Invasive Plant Council (Cal-IPC) Rating: High\nHigh – These species have severe ecological impacts on physical processes, plant and animal communities, and vegetation structure. Their reproductive biology and other attributes are conducive to moderate to high rates of dispersal and establishment. Most are widely distributed ecologically.\nCalifornia Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Rating: -*\n* – included in the CCR Section 4500 list of California State Noxious Weeds.\n\n\nLORP Area Filter Applied:\n- Northernmost 2025 point latitude: 36.9747 °N\n- Filtered dataset now contains 1647 observations\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset includes 1647 total observations across 8 years, with peak survey activity in 2025 (426 records).\n\n\n\n\nTotal Observations: 1647 records across all years (2018-2025)\nPeak Survey Year: 2025 with 426 observations\nRecent Activity: 852 observations in 2022-2025\nHistorical Baseline: 795 observations in 2018-2021\nData Coverage: 100% of records have complete date information (using observation date with creation date fallback)"
